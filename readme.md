## Instrction for running the code

# All the submitted Notebooks were run on Kaggle.
# So, to run and reproduce th results, one can just upload the notebook on the kaggle notebook and click on run all button.
# All the libraries will be pre-installed on the kaggle's kernel

## Code for Custom MLP + CNN

# We provide a notebook that contains code for custom MLP with CNN, in this code we just change the MLP class of task1 that used numpy arrays with pytorch tenosrs.
# Also, the cvtask2final notebook has CNN models that contains nn.Linear layers.

# Please note that: for the CNN Model we have only provided the notebook of our best model, for the side experiments we had different notebooks that we have not inculded in the zip file.
